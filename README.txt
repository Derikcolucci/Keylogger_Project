Educational keylogger goals/description:
    1. Ability to track keys typed and process them in real time: complete.
    2. Tracking keys typed in a specific period of time for easy reading and tracking: complete.
    3. Email capability to send after a desginated amount of inputs: complete.
        Added a keyword search to the email functionality to list in the subject bar of the email, potentially for labeling higher priority.

Improvements that can be added in the future:
    1. Task manager detection: close the program and send current contents when task manager is opened.
        Can be useful to avoid detection if the computers security system hasnt already.
    2. Time oriented emailing is probably more useful than a max user inpput variable.
        Emailing after an elapsed amount of time will help organize content that is likely related.
        Helps to ensure the email is not also cutting off user inputs if they are surpassing the set max.
